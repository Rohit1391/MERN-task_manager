Use these steps to setup the whole app locally:
-> git clone https://github.com/Rohit1391/MERN-task_manager.git (to clone the repo)
-> cd task manager
-> cd backend
-> npm install (install the dependencies)
-> create a .env file in your backend and write:
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string_here
-> npm start ( start the backend server)
-> cd ../frontend (now go to the frontend folder)
-> npm install
-> npm start
And you are done!
